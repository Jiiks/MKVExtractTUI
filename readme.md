## Features

- **Terminal UI:** Easy navigation and control for users who prefer working in the terminal.

- **Track Information:** View detailed information about each track, including track index, language, codec, and more.

- **Custom Naming:** Customize the output file names based on track properties.

- **Multi-Track Support:** Extract multiple subtitle tracks simultaneously.

## Usage
Download from releases as binary.
To launch Mkv(Sub)ExtractTUI, simply run the binary.

Latest version automatically with curl:
```bash
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/Jiiks/MKVExtractTUI/releases/latest | grep "browser_download_url" | cut -d : -f 2,3 | xargs -I {} sh -c 'curl -L -O {}; chmod +x $(basename {})'
```

Custom input directory:
`mkvetui -i <path>`
otherwise current working directory is used.

`mkvetui -h` for help.

Command line switches:

`-n | --nogui` `Run guiless and extract all tracks that are tagged to auto check.`

`-a | --all` `auto check all tracks.`

`-q | --quiet` `suppress output.`

`-f | --fastupdate` `Fast update gui where applicable.`

Command line options:

`-i | --input <path>` `Specify input file or directory.`

`-p | --pattern <pattern>` `Specify custom renaming pattern. Default "fn.flags.lang.ext"`

```bash
fn     replaced with filename.
flags  replaced with flags such as sdh.
lang   replaced with language tag such as eng.
ext    replaced with extension such as srt.

eg. Some Movie.mkv => Some Movie.default.sdh.eng.srt
Where the track has default, sdh tags, language is eng and format is srt.
```

`-l | --lang <tags>` `Auto check all tracks matching language tags separated with [,]. Default: "en,eng"`

Settings are located in `/home/user/.config/MkvExtractTUI`or`XDG_CONFIG_HOME/MkvExtractTUI`
